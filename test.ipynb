Also, an email from Will Beckett confirms what I saw,\\nthe L3 EVSE has a physical problem: the strain relief on the L3 coupler cable came lose (or was never installed correctly), thus that cable is possibly hanging by its  connected wires. If you use the L3 EVSE, be gentle with that cable. Drivers should send an email to the Center stating the cable needs fixing, and there is needs to be EV-Only signage at the 5 ft height to keep ice out. Use http://www.simon.com/mall/guestservices.aspx?id=841 to send in a maintenance request.\",\n",
